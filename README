Requirements:
* Should encrypt the message into the database
Accomplishes this via the 'encryptor' gem

* Should generate a unique URL for each message
Base58 encodes the message id and stores the value for lookup. While this is unique, it could be better.

* Should decrypt the message and delete it upon retrieval

Yet to come:
Bonus:
* Should allow for an optional password
* If specifying a password, it should use that as the salt for the encrypted message
* Good design
* Fancy javascript
* Rails 3
* API access
